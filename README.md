## 1 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
---
Before cryptocurrency mining turned out to be an expensive business model in terms of initial investment and maintenance, this was a sector that was fractioned and generally distributed between a few thousand individuals, whose activity resulted in having a low environmental impact and its profitability rised exponentially inside a transparency model with democratized rules which facilitated the power of decision inside the network.

Today, because of the huge rise in the use of cryptocurrencies and Blockchain (which has led to a rise of the traffic within transactions, reducing profitability at the same time) making a small **mining business** so non-viable for its primary outlays (infrastructure, servers) and expenses (electricity, maintenance, fixing servers, etc.), it is vital to arran-ge a competitive system that allows to maintain the updated hash power and the increase in the mining dificulty over time, as well as the ability to adapt for the upcoming technological developments in the crypto-mining market.

It is here where CryptoSolarTech comes onto the scene.

CryptoSolarTech is a Spanish Blockchain project of positive impact coming up from one of the most potential niches of the Blockchain market worldwide, integrating renewa-ble energy and cryptocurrency mining in the same project, employing photovoltaic solar panels to create enough electricity to supply the overwhelming energy consumption of the mining activity.  
CST is backed by some some of the best Blockchain, cryptocurrency mining experts such as CoinFabrik and PuzzleGold, assisted as well by Respira Energia (renewables), and IG (business development).  

CryptoSolarTech will mine cryptocurrencies from a farm of up to 3,000 mining servers managed by the company itself. The energy will be indirectly supplied from several photovoltaic solar panels at a solar field installed in Spain and will also provide rental services to CST token holders. Ethereum Blockchain platform will be used for the mana-gement, income distribution and tangible asset start-up of the project.

By doing this, common problems in the mining sector will be solved, such as the high expenses in crypto-mining electricity (bringing them down to levels close to 0 €), the inaccessibility resulted by the centralization and monopolization of mining power in the hands of large corporations, usage of non-renewable energy in crypto-mining (mainly fossil and nuclear resources) and marginalization of customers/investors who are not qualified or have little knowledge in mining and are looking forward into this business model of infinite opportunities.

It will be one of the safest options and opportunities to participate in the cryptocurrency market with no chance of losing: cryptocurrency mining will always bring an advantage to the user.

The purpose of this ICO is to obtain enough funding to create a cryptocurrency mining farm and install the photovoltaic solar plant meant to supply the mining equipment with cheap and clean energy after aquiring the servers.

During the ICO a total amount of 1.26 billion tokens will be issued under the name of CryptoSolarTech Token, the ticker will be CST. All unsold tokens at the end of the ICO will be burned.

### 1.1 WHY SHOULD YOU INVEST IN CRYPTOSOLARTECH?

CryptoSolarTech is a project that comes from the hands of two Spanish cryptocurrency and Blockchain pioneers, Pablo Alonso and Alain Aguirre. It is a new wave meant to transform the world of cryptocurrency mining and at the same time strengthen the Blockchain network.

It will use sustainable energy to carry out the cryptomining process, which will help to reduce the environmental impact and be able to consume energy at a user level that comes from clean and renewable sources. It will reduce both the consumption of electricity and therefore the energy expenditure, and customers will obtain a profitability through the tokens and its platform, well above what any current photovoltaic / solar energy project can offer. This will also take the mining of cryptocurrency to a new and more favorable level for the environment and, at at the same time, maximazing effciency.

In addition, CryptoSolarTech provides investors the opportunity to participate in a high-risk market such as the cryptocurrency market, obtaining a very high return, but holding all the investment in a low risk market with high profitability such as the solar energy market.

What distinguish us from other mining services -pools- is that the signed contract to make your rented ASIC –mining server- operative, is a long-term contract due to the CST token is non-expirable as long as you hold them. That is, even if mining or electricity costs go up, your ASIC will never stop working since the energy cost is already covered (15-year extendable supply contract with Respira Energía).

When acquiring the CST token, the investor gains access to the mining platform by deciding if he himself will be the actual individual miner or if he decides to select one rate with a fixed profitability, being the CryptoSolarTech team the one providing the mining activity, following predetermined profitability plans.

According with this, CryptoSolarTech is the SAFEST way for the investor to participate in the high-risk crypto market since the solar energy plant supports all the invest-ment.

Also, CryptoSolarTech has a long-term sustainable project since there is a possibility of tokenizing the solar energy in the future with a minimum profitability of the 8%.

Last but not least, CryptoSolarTech is a project that is committed to clean energy, so by investing in it, we take a step forward in the battle against climate change, making possible the mining of cryptocurrencies, respecting the environment at the same time.

## 2. BACKGROUND
---
### 2.1 CHALLENGES

International summit for climate in Paris established as a fundamental objective to limit global warming to 2°C before the year 2100.

To achieve this goal, it will be necessary to invest an additional $1 billion each year in renewable energy and sustainability projects until 2050, but there is a problem with current investment levels, which are still far below the target. This was something that became a major concern at the recent meetings of the World Climate Conference or UNFCCC Cop23.

On the other hand, as the public sector struggles to make progress in financing renewables, the pressure on the private sector increases. This was shown at the last confe-rence in Bonn.

The burning of fossil fuels to obtain electricity represents 25% of the greenhouse gases of the entire planet and they are limited resources. Renewable energies, instead, are not limited and the environmental impact is minimal or unexistent. It is expected that by 2040 renewable energies will attract up to 60% of the total investment in global power generation capacity (11.4 trillion USD) according to an estimation by Bloomberg New Energy Finance. That is why they also represent a strong business opportunity.

This type of energy has also become one of the preferred methods to feed cryptocurrency miners as prices rise and the industry seeks more computing power or hash power at the cheapest energy expense. While original fuels (such as coal) remain basic to many supply networks, large miners such as Bitmain Technologies Ltd., HIVE Blockchain Technologies Ltd. and Bitfury Group use clean energy in places like Canada, Iceland and Paraguay and attract investors worried about the carbon footprint originated by this business model as a whole.

Spain has privileged sun conditions for a projects such as CryptoSolarTech to stand out in terms of power generation: 2,500 kW per hour / m2. Now with CryptoSolar-Tech, any crypto-mining investor can use the potential advantage of this country. It is the first place in the world where the model of renewable solar energy system as we know it today has been developed and implemented worldwide.

Electricity can represent up to 70% of the total cost of operations for mining servers. Therefore, it makes sense for miners to go to places where the cost of electricity is che-aper - renewable energy has become cheaper than other energy resources.

Solar energy now costs a few cents per kW/hour so it is more competitive than fossil fuels. Iceland, where geothermal and hydroelectric power is abundant and cheap, has attracted several mining operations. In China´s Sichuan Province several hydroelectric facilities were developed to supply cities that were never built, but are now used to mine Bitcoins.

CryptoSolarTech will solve the problem of the energy cost of cryptocurrency mining using the facilities of solar plants to provide energy that can sustain and operate the mining plants at an efficient energy cost in a long-term operation period.

As we know, the cost of electricity represents the biggest expense in the mining plants, therefore, CryptoSolarTech looks for the synergy of the efficient cost of electricity and the token holders, so they have the right to access the facilities at a very competitive price. Like this, this business approach allows the token holders to exploit it at a lower cost than the current market. CryptoSolarTech has a competitive advantage that allows it to be ahead in the mining market and maintain this position in the competition of the cryptocurrency market in the medium and long term.

Normally, participants in this market do not have, in the first stage, access to bank loans or the stock market, so they generally depend on subsidies, government or public loans, loans from the private sector and risk capital for financing. Established companies can finance all or part of their projects internally, with the available cash-flow.

Companies in the intermediate stage may not be chosen for government support and most grants are insufficient to provide the necessary funding. These companies also do not generate enough attention to produce a stable and supportive regulatory environment, which would increase investor confidence. Instead, they can self-finance with inside cash-flow, use internal or external loans, or attract private capital from investors.

For participants who entered at the last stages, investor security makes large-scale investments possible, enabled by complex capital, debt tools such as SPV´s and green bonds. Companies with proven technologies and reliable returns are especially attractive to investors with explicit fiduciary obligations and investment restrictions, such as pension funds. Financing options tend to increase as companies or technologies reach the later stages of maturity, markets stabilize, risks decrease and potential returns become more predictable.

In this general environment, CryptoSolarTech can have access to finance its new facilities through a Token Generator Event, making a new approach to the cryptocurrency mining sector that makes it possible to extract at a more competitive electricity cost than before. At the same time, solve the huge concerns about energy consumption related to cryptocurrency mining and put its grain of sand for the growth of the photovoltaic-solar market.

### 2.2 ADVANTAGES OF USING BLOCKCHAIN ALONG WITH SOLAR PANELS AND MINING SERVERS

With the aim of shortening distances so that the solar and mining sector works carrying out a process in which they obtain mutual benefits, the use of the Blockchain technology provides a complementary solution that increases the added value of both by working simultaneously. These are the additional benefits that Blockchain adds to the project:

* DECENTRALIZED TRADABILITY

Allowing the project’s marketability to be decentralized (YieldCos, green bonds, asset backed securities and ARM’s) in a faster and safer way. The Blockchain allows financing in a decentralized scope of work to the main participants in the financial markets, giving power to the tokens of the holders as new participants, instead of a club agreement of intermediary institutions.

Due to the Blockchain´s open source, this technology is specially interesting for companies. That means that other users or developers have the opportunity to modify it as they wish, but the most important thing about it is that changing the gathered data within a chain of blocks is incredibly difficult. After all, if there are countless eyes on the network, someone will probably see that the recorded data has been altered. This makes Blockchain a particularly safe and reliable technology.

* LOWEST TRANSACTION COST

Blockchain allows P2P and B2B transactions to be completed without the need of a third party, which is usually a bank. Since there is no participation of intermediaries linked to Blockchain transactions, costs for the user or companies can be reduced over time.

* FASTER TRANSACTION AGREEMENTS

When it comes to mainstream banking, it is common for transactions to take days to confirm completely. This is due to the bank transfer software and protocols, as well as the fact that financial institutions only open during normal business hours, five days a week. There are also financial institutions located in several time zones around the world, which may delay processing times. However, the Blockchain technology is running 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, which means that Blockchain-based transactions are processed considerably quicker.

* DECENTRALIZED TRANSACTION VERIFICATION

Another important reason why Blockchain is so interesting is the lack of a central data center. Instead of running a massive data center and verifying transactions through that center, Blockchain allows individual transactions to have their own proof of confirmation and authorization to carry out those restrictions. With the information about a gradual Blockchain around the world based on individual servers, it guarantees that if the information falls into unwanted hands (for example, a cybercriminal), only a small amount of data and not the entire network, would be compromised.

* NETWORKS CONTROLLED BY THE USER

Finally, cryptocurrency investors tend to be really motivated by the different management aspects of Blockchain. Instead of having a third party to run the program, users and developers have the final say. For example, the impossibility of reaching an 80% consensus on an update linked to the Bitcoin Blockchain is what evolved into a fork creating two different currencies (Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash) more than four months ago. Opinions go all the way concerning investors and developers. 

Therefore, it is stated that thanks to this complete, consistent, timely, accurate and widely available technology, users will control their information and transactions, trusting that it will be executed exactly as the protocol commands, disposing the need for a trusted intermediary. Changes in Blockchain are publicly verified by all parties achieving the necessary transparency and all of them are immutable. They will be added to this particular public accounting spreadsheet called Blockchain, getting rid of potential disorder that could lead to errors or complications in regular accounting books.

### 3.1 ENERGY COST

Currently, it is very expensive to maintain a constant source of energy from renewable sources 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

That is why a mining project would be unsustainable in Europe due to the high costs of electricity, added to the volatility of the cryptocurrency market.

To solve this problem, this company will invest parallelly in two independent projects:

A first project of photovoltaic-solar plant installed in Southern Spain which will produce energy for 6 to 10 hours / day; all the energy produced will be acquired through the PPA (Energy Purchase Agreement) at a fixed price for the next 15 years as agreed in the contract with partner Respira Energia, granting a fixed income for the same period and with a ROI of 11.03% (8.19% after taxes).

A second project of up to 3,000 mining servers - ASICs- installed in an industrial warehouse that will mine cryptocurrencies from the cloud; its energy will exclusively come from the photovoltaic solar power plants capable of generating 45,000 kW, enough power to supply the mining farm completely.

On the one hand, there are up to 3,000 mining servers operating at 863.33 kWh x 1.1 x 24 hours; we estimate 68.376 KWh / day of energy consumption. Buying the power in the network at a rate of € 0.14 / kWh, costs shall be € 9,572.64 / day.

On the other hand, by generating 45,000 kW x 6 hours at the photovoltaic plant (model in image), we can estimate a supply of 271,000 kWh / day. If we were to sell the gene-rated energy inside PPA margins to Respira Energía at € 0.045 / kWh, gross income shall be € 12,195 / day or a cash-flow of € 3,557,733. That means € 9,747.21 cash-flow is set to accomplish payments to the miners’ energy consumption and obtain a surplus of € 174.57 / day at the same time.

Considering this fixed energy capacity and guaranteed income, we shall simultaneously yield that income to buy energy capacity to supply 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to operate the mining farm, guaranteeing there shall be no loss in capital for bearing more energy expenditure than mining in times of low performance.

These are the potential cases of mining production in terms of Bitcoin spot price on the 04/27/2018 (1 BTC = € 7,648.07), current mining difficulty, network power calculation, algorithm distribution, Token holder distribution and operation and, management costs.
