# CRYPTOSOLARTECH
## BLOCKCHAIN WITH RENEWABLE ENERGIES

## 1 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
---
Before cryptocurrency mining turned out to be an expensive business model in terms of initial investment and maintenance, this was a sector that was fractioned and generally distributed between a few thousand individuals, whose activity resulted in having a low environmental impact and its profitability rised exponentially inside a transparency model with democratized rules which facilitated the power of decision inside the network.

Today, because of the huge rise in the use of cryptocurrencies and Blockchain (which has led to a rise of the traffic within transactions, reducing profitability at the same time) making a small **mining business** so non-viable for its primary outlays (infrastructure, servers) and expenses (electricity, maintenance, fixing servers, etc.), it is vital to arran-ge a competitive system that allows to maintain the updated hash power and the increase in the mining dificulty over time, as well as the ability to adapt for the upcoming technological developments in the crypto-mining market.

It is here where CryptoSolarTech comes onto the scene.

CryptoSolarTech is a Spanish Blockchain project of positive impact coming up from one of the most potential niches of the Blockchain market worldwide, integrating renewa-ble energy and cryptocurrency mining in the same project, employing photovoltaic solar panels to create enough electricity to supply the overwhelming energy consumption of the mining activity.  
CST is backed by some some of the best Blockchain, cryptocurrency mining experts such as CoinFabrik and PuzzleGold, assisted as well by Respira Energia (renewables), and IG (business development).  

CryptoSolarTech will mine cryptocurrencies from a farm of up to 3,000 mining servers managed by the company itself. The energy will be indirectly supplied from several photovoltaic solar panels at a solar field installed in Spain and will also provide rental services to CST token holders. Ethereum Blockchain platform will be used for the mana-gement, income distribution and tangible asset start-up of the project.

By doing this, common problems in the mining sector will be solved, such as the high expenses in crypto-mining electricity (bringing them down to levels close to 0 €), the inaccessibility resulted by the centralization and monopolization of mining power in the hands of large corporations, usage of non-renewable energy in crypto-mining (mainly fossil and nuclear resources) and marginalization of customers/investors who are not qualified or have little knowledge in mining and are looking forward into this business model of infinite opportunities.

It will be one of the safest options and opportunities to participate in the cryptocurrency market with no chance of losing: cryptocurrency mining will always bring an advantage to the user.

The purpose of this ICO is to obtain enough funding to create a cryptocurrency mining farm and install the photovoltaic solar plant meant to supply the mining equipment with cheap and clean energy after aquiring the servers.

During the ICO a total amount of 1.26 billion tokens will be issued under the name of CryptoSolarTech Token, the ticker will be CST. All unsold tokens at the end of the ICO will be burned.

### 1.1 WHY SHOULD YOU INVEST IN CRYPTOSOLARTECH?

CryptoSolarTech is a project that comes from the hands of two Spanish cryptocurrency and Blockchain pioneers, Pablo Alonso and Alain Aguirre. It is a new wave meant to transform the world of cryptocurrency mining and at the same time strengthen the Blockchain network.

It will use sustainable energy to carry out the cryptomining process, which will help to reduce the environmental impact and be able to consume energy at a user level that comes from clean and renewable sources. It will reduce both the consumption of electricity and therefore the energy expenditure, and customers will obtain a profitability through the tokens and its platform, well above what any current photovoltaic / solar energy project can offer. This will also take the mining of cryptocurrency to a new and more favorable level for the environment and, at at the same time, maximazing effciency.

In addition, CryptoSolarTech provides investors the opportunity to participate in a high-risk market such as the cryptocurrency market, obtaining a very high return, but holding all the investment in a low risk market with high profitability such as the solar energy market.

What distinguish us from other mining services -pools- is that the signed contract to make your rented ASIC –mining server- operative, is a long-term contract due to the CST token is non-expirable as long as you hold them. That is, even if mining or electricity costs go up, your ASIC will never stop working since the energy cost is already covered (15-year extendable supply contract with Respira Energía).

When acquiring the CST token, the investor gains access to the mining platform by deciding if he himself will be the actual individual miner or if he decides to select one rate with a fixed profitability, being the CryptoSolarTech team the one providing the mining activity, following predetermined profitability plans.

According with this, CryptoSolarTech is the SAFEST way for the investor to participate in the high-risk crypto market since the solar energy plant supports all the invest-ment.

Also, CryptoSolarTech has a long-term sustainable project since there is a possibility of tokenizing the solar energy in the future with a minimum profitability of the 8%.

Last but not least, CryptoSolarTech is a project that is committed to clean energy, so by investing in it, we take a step forward in the battle against climate change, making possible the mining of cryptocurrencies, respecting the environment at the same time.

## 2. BACKGROUND
---
### 2.1 CHALLENGES

International summit for climate in Paris established as a fundamental objective to limit global warming to 2°C before the year 2100.

To achieve this goal, it will be necessary to invest an additional $1 billion each year in renewable energy and sustainability projects until 2050, but there is a problem with current investment levels, which are still far below the target. This was something that became a major concern at the recent meetings of the World Climate Conference or UNFCCC Cop23.

On the other hand, as the public sector struggles to make progress in financing renewables, the pressure on the private sector increases. This was shown at the last confe-rence in Bonn.

The burning of fossil fuels to obtain electricity represents 25% of the greenhouse gases of the entire planet and they are limited resources. Renewable energies, instead, are not limited and the environmental impact is minimal or unexistent. It is expected that by 2040 renewable energies will attract up to 60% of the total investment in global power generation capacity (11.4 trillion USD) according to an estimation by Bloomberg New Energy Finance. That is why they also represent a strong business opportunity.

This type of energy has also become one of the preferred methods to feed cryptocurrency miners as prices rise and the industry seeks more computing power or hash power at the cheapest energy expense. While original fuels (such as coal) remain basic to many supply networks, large miners such as Bitmain Technologies Ltd., HIVE Blockchain Technologies Ltd. and Bitfury Group use clean energy in places like Canada, Iceland and Paraguay and attract investors worried about the carbon footprint originated by this business model as a whole.

Spain has privileged sun conditions for a projects such as CryptoSolarTech to stand out in terms of power generation: 2,500 kW per hour / m2. Now with CryptoSolar-Tech, any crypto-mining investor can use the potential advantage of this country. It is the first place in the world where the model of renewable solar energy system as we know it today has been developed and implemented worldwide.

Electricity can represent up to 70% of the total cost of operations for mining servers. Therefore, it makes sense for miners to go to places where the cost of electricity is che-aper - renewable energy has become cheaper than other energy resources.

Solar energy now costs a few cents per kW/hour so it is more competitive than fossil fuels. Iceland, where geothermal and hydroelectric power is abundant and cheap, has attracted several mining operations. In China´s Sichuan Province several hydroelectric facilities were developed to supply cities that were never built, but are now used to mine Bitcoins.

CryptoSolarTech will solve the problem of the energy cost of cryptocurrency mining using the facilities of solar plants to provide energy that can sustain and operate the mining plants at an efficient energy cost in a long-term operation period.

As we know, the cost of electricity represents the biggest expense in the mining plants, therefore, CryptoSolarTech looks for the synergy of the efficient cost of electricity and the token holders, so they have the right to access the facilities at a very competitive price. Like this, this business approach allows the token holders to exploit it at a lower cost than the current market. CryptoSolarTech has a competitive advantage that allows it to be ahead in the mining market and maintain this position in the competition of the cryptocurrency market in the medium and long term.

Normally, participants in this market do not have, in the first stage, access to bank loans or the stock market, so they generally depend on subsidies, government or public loans, loans from the private sector and risk capital for financing. Established companies can finance all or part of their projects internally, with the available cash-flow.

Companies in the intermediate stage may not be chosen for government support and most grants are insufficient to provide the necessary funding. These companies also do not generate enough attention to produce a stable and supportive regulatory environment, which would increase investor confidence. Instead, they can self-finance with inside cash-flow, use internal or external loans, or attract private capital from investors.

For participants who entered at the last stages, investor security makes large-scale investments possible, enabled by complex capital, debt tools such as SPV´s and green bonds. Companies with proven technologies and reliable returns are especially attractive to investors with explicit fiduciary obligations and investment restrictions, such as pension funds. Financing options tend to increase as companies or technologies reach the later stages of maturity, markets stabilize, risks decrease and potential returns become more predictable.

In this general environment, CryptoSolarTech can have access to finance its new facilities through a Token Generator Event, making a new approach to the cryptocurrency mining sector that makes it possible to extract at a more competitive electricity cost than before. At the same time, solve the huge concerns about energy consumption related to cryptocurrency mining and put its grain of sand for the growth of the photovoltaic-solar market.

### 2.2 ADVANTAGES OF USING BLOCKCHAIN ALONG WITH SOLAR PANELS AND MINING SERVERS

With the aim of shortening distances so that the solar and mining sector works carrying out a process in which they obtain mutual benefits, the use of the Blockchain technology provides a complementary solution that increases the added value of both by working simultaneously. These are the additional benefits that Blockchain adds to the project:

* DECENTRALIZED TRADABILITY

Allowing the project’s marketability to be decentralized (YieldCos, green bonds, asset backed securities and ARM’s) in a faster and safer way. The Blockchain allows financing in a decentralized scope of work to the main participants in the financial markets, giving power to the tokens of the holders as new participants, instead of a club agreement of intermediary institutions.

Due to the Blockchain´s open source, this technology is specially interesting for companies. That means that other users or developers have the opportunity to modify it as they wish, but the most important thing about it is that changing the gathered data within a chain of blocks is incredibly difficult. After all, if there are countless eyes on the network, someone will probably see that the recorded data has been altered. This makes Blockchain a particularly safe and reliable technology.

* LOWEST TRANSACTION COST

Blockchain allows P2P and B2B transactions to be completed without the need of a third party, which is usually a bank. Since there is no participation of intermediaries linked to Blockchain transactions, costs for the user or companies can be reduced over time.

* FASTER TRANSACTION AGREEMENTS

When it comes to mainstream banking, it is common for transactions to take days to confirm completely. This is due to the bank transfer software and protocols, as well as the fact that financial institutions only open during normal business hours, five days a week. There are also financial institutions located in several time zones around the world, which may delay processing times. However, the Blockchain technology is running 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, which means that Blockchain-based transactions are processed considerably quicker.

* DECENTRALIZED TRANSACTION VERIFICATION

Another important reason why Blockchain is so interesting is the lack of a central data center. Instead of running a massive data center and verifying transactions through that center, Blockchain allows individual transactions to have their own proof of confirmation and authorization to carry out those restrictions. With the information about a gradual Blockchain around the world based on individual servers, it guarantees that if the information falls into unwanted hands (for example, a cybercriminal), only a small amount of data and not the entire network, would be compromised.

* NETWORKS CONTROLLED BY THE USER

Finally, cryptocurrency investors tend to be really motivated by the different management aspects of Blockchain. Instead of having a third party to run the program, users and developers have the final say. For example, the impossibility of reaching an 80% consensus on an update linked to the Bitcoin Blockchain is what evolved into a fork creating two different currencies (Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash) more than four months ago. Opinions go all the way concerning investors and developers. 

Therefore, it is stated that thanks to this complete, consistent, timely, accurate and widely available technology, users will control their information and transactions, trusting that it will be executed exactly as the protocol commands, disposing the need for a trusted intermediary. Changes in Blockchain are publicly verified by all parties achieving the necessary transparency and all of them are immutable. They will be added to this particular public accounting spreadsheet called Blockchain, getting rid of potential disorder that could lead to errors or complications in regular accounting books.

## 3. CryptoSolarTech SOLUTIONS

### 3.1 ENERGY COST

Currently, it is very expensive to maintain a constant source of energy from renewable sources 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

That is why a mining project would be unsustainable in Europe due to the high costs of electricity, added to the volatility of the cryptocurrency market.

To solve this problem, this company will invest parallelly in two independent projects:

A first project of photovoltaic-solar plant installed in Southern Spain which will produce energy for 6 to 10 hours / day; all the energy produced will be acquired through the PPA (Energy Purchase Agreement) at a fixed price for the next 15 years as agreed in the contract with partner Respira Energia, granting a fixed income for the same period and with a ROI of 11.03% (8.19% after taxes).

A second project of up to 3,000 mining servers - ASICs- installed in an industrial warehouse that will mine cryptocurrencies from the cloud; its energy will exclusively come from the photovoltaic solar power plants capable of generating 45,000 kW, enough power to supply the mining farm completely.

On the one hand, there are up to 3,000 mining servers operating at 863.33 kWh x 1.1 x 24 hours; we estimate 68.376 KWh / day of energy consumption. Buying the power in the network at a rate of € 0.14 / kWh, costs shall be € 9,572.64 / day.

On the other hand, by generating 45,000 kW x 6 hours at the photovoltaic plant (model in image), we can estimate a supply of 271,000 kWh / day. If we were to sell the gene-rated energy inside PPA margins to Respira Energía at € 0.045 / kWh, gross income shall be € 12,195 / day or a cash-flow of € 3,557,733. That means € 9,747.21 cash-flow is set to accomplish payments to the miners’ energy consumption and obtain a surplus of € 174.57 / day at the same time.

Considering this fixed energy capacity and guaranteed income, we shall simultaneously yield that income to buy energy capacity to supply 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to operate the mining farm, guaranteeing there shall be no loss in capital for bearing more energy expenditure than mining in times of low performance.

These are the potential cases of mining production in terms of Bitcoin spot price on the 04/27/2018 (1 BTC = € 7,648.07), current mining difficulty, network power calculation, algorithm distribution, Token holder distribution and operation and, management costs.

 ## 4. ECOSYSTEM & CST TOKENOMICS
---
### 4.1 TOKENOMICS: UTILITY TOKEN CST

CryptoSolarTech (CST) is a digital asset classified as a Utility Token according to the parameters established in the Howey test (1946) that international regulator agencies use to determine if a digital asset can be considered as a security and be subject to regulation standards due to its financial nature (representing a fraction of a company, rights to collect dividends,etc.) or if, on the contrary, it is a digital asset that represents an instrument or a right to future services and products of a company such as the CST token, which will also have a payment function and will be limited to the tokenized ecosystem of CryptoSolarTech.

CryptoSolarTech Token does not offer the holder a minimum return on assets or a fraction of profits from CryptoSolarTech company. By acquiring the CST token, computing power is acquired in the energy market. This token gives access to the mining platform. If the token holder choses not to use this tool, the token will not provide any return by itself, so it does not guarantee a minimum return. On the other hand, this token will provide access to the platform so the holder can choose between individual mining or that of which the CrypotSolarTech team will mine through the different mining plans based on a fixed annual profitability from the solar energy produced plus the mined cryp-tocurrencies, and never from the token as an asset itself.

The possession of the CST tokens will entail the right of access to the rental of a fraction of the cryptocurrency mining farm that will be located in an industrial warehouse in Malaga (Spain) enabled for this activity, and the location of the photovoltaic plant being situated in the province of Seville (Spain).


A CryptoSolarTech 'in situ' service center will also be enabled, which will minimize the downtime of a mining equipment throughout a mainteinance phase, minimizing down-time (93.5% of minimum), thus achieving a much more efficient mining operation.

### 4.2 CST TOKEN SALE

CST (Features, TGE & Caps):

**Ticker**|**CST**
:-----:|:-----:

€/CST|0.07 €
Token Nature|Utility Token
Soft Cap|19,647,667 CST
Hard Cap|1,260,000,000 CST

The sale of tokens, together with its allocation and distribution, will be held as follows:

* PRIVATE SALE:

It will start before the TGE and will represent 16.67% of the total token sale (210,000,000 CST) which will be acquired at a price of 0.05 €. Potential buyers reserve the right to receive the tokens by signing a non-transferable or negotiable agreement tailored along with CryptoSolarTech, which will act as custodian of the contributions.

Access to the private sale will be by invitation only and it is expected to begin on April 16th, 2018 and continue until April 30th. Issued tokens from the fund raising by the company will be distributed at the latest, several hours before the start of the TGE.

* PUBLIC / CROWDSALE:

The public sale will be automatically processed after completing the private sale and will include a security measure for the buyers that will protect them and eliminate the need for an escrow. Unsold tokens during the private sale will be available for crowdsale, to be added to the remaining 798,000,000 CST (63.33% of the total). Initial price will start at € 0.06 and will extend to € 0.10 in the last phase of the TGE.

Payments will be available in ETH, BTC and EUR. The CST / ETH, CST / BTC, CST / EUR or CST / USD parities will be secured based on the spot exchange rate from the start date of the crowdsale process and it is expected to last at least 2.5 months. 

* TOKEN DISTRIBUTION

Team members will keep 15% of the total amount of the sale and prices will be granted from a 50% discount to a 0% discount throughout the different phases of the token sale, until the end of the TGE. The price of each CryptoSolarTech token or CST is € 0.07 / token, and will be offered from € 0.05 / token to € 0.10 / token. Therefore, the initial rate depends on the day of acquisition.

TOKEN DISTRIBUTION:

·|**Total (€)**|**Total Amount (CST)**|**%**
:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:
Project development|57,120,000.00|1,008,000,000.00|80.00%
Team / Bounties|10,710,000.00|189,000,000.00|15.00%
Legal team & Advisors|1,428,000.00|25,200,000.00|2.00%
Marketing|2,142,000.00|37,800,000.00|3.00%
Market CAP|71,400,000.00|1,260,000,000.00| 

Token price has been calculated into € under the assumption that 16.67% is sold for private sale and the remaining 63.33% is sold for public sale.

• RESERVE AND R&D

To ease potential expansion, team members will hold 5% of the total token supply in reserve for 36 months. This reserve can be used to accelerate the expansion and establi-shment of ecosystems, including, among others, market launches outside the perimeter of the central platform in Spain, the establishment of new territories, as well as reward programs and strategic initiatives for the deployment of the CryptoSolarTech platform worldwide. 

• TEAM AND BOUNTIES

This token allocation percentage will be divided between the team bonuses and the current bounties.

The blocking periods for the team´s allocation will be fractioned as follows:

-10% of the tokens will not be subject to lock-up
-45% of the tokens will have a lock-up period of 12 months
-40% of the tokens will have a lock-up period of 18 months
-5% of the tokens will have a lock-up period of 36 months

The blocking periods for the Legal, Advisors and Marketing agencies allocation will be governed as follows:

-90% of the Legal, Advisors and Marketing tokens will be immediately granted to the distribution of the tokens at the end of the token sale.
-10% of Advisors´ tokens will have a 6-month lock-up period.

During the private sale, several blocking periods could be determined in a manner similar to those established for the team.

• INVESTMENT PLANTS

Initially, the location of the solar plant will be in the province of Seville (Spain) and the mining exploitation will be in Malaga (Spain) in an industrial warehouse enabled for this activity.

## 5. COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE
---
## 5.1 MARKET FEATURES

There are few mining projects in the sector that are linked to the integration of clean energy sources and cheap production around the world, concentrated mostly in countries where the Blockchain community is very determinant.

The Japanese solar energy producer Kumamoto-Energy opened its subsidiary OZ Mining with the intention of using the surplus energy to feed mining equipment and hopes to expand its market by selling this system to other companies so that mining is more profitable and affordable in the Japanese region, where it is located.

On the other hand, the start-up Envion has developed a mobile mining unit that will use local energy at a low price in a wide range of countries from solar sources, wind power, but also fossil fuels, so it should not be considered to investors a 100% green or sustainable project. 

It is important to mention the Australian Hadouken Pty Ltd., who acquired 57 hectares in New South Wales in April 2018 that will house a total of 69,000 panels capable of generating 20 MW dedicated exclusively to the mining of cryptocurrencies.

Last but not least, there are other start-ups that have managed to successfully finance their projects thanks to the collaboration of the community and external investors such as the European WePower and the Australian Power Ledger, focused on lowering the cost of energy generated exclusively from renewable sources developing energy tokenization for homes and Smart-cities. 

It can therefore be concluded that the current competition is still in phases of development of its infrastructures, achieving very good results even in its early stages of deve-lopment. Yet another reason to add and strengthen the vision of the business model that CryptoSolarTech wants to implement.

In addition, the most differentiating feature of CryptoSolarTech in relation to its competitors revolves around the operating contract of the ASIC In the rest of the companies that are within the mining sector. Our contract so that the ASIC we have rented is active, depends on the costs associated with it, does not exceed the income.

This means, that in many cases, the increase in the price of electricity or the increase in the difficulty of mining, makes our ASIC disconnect and stop its functioning.

At CryptoSolarTech, we have a 15-year power supply contract (available on our website) so the cost associated with the energy is already assumed and at no time will the operation of your ASIC be interrupted: it is a contract for life, it does not depend on price volatility in the energy market or the increase in difficulty, therefore it is guaranteed that your ASIC will be always operative.

## 6. TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS. BLOCKCHAIN.
---
## 6.1 CST TOKEN

CST is an ERC-20 standard token operating in the Ethereum network, a decentralized open source platform that allows the creation of smart contracts where a developer can create applications (dApps) and make such contracts. Ethereum will allow to make transactions of the CST token over time in a transparent and verifiable way.

The sale of the CST tokens will be carried out through a platform developed by CoinFabrik, a company with a great experience in the cryptocurrency market and the develo-pment of Blockchain technology, as well as the purchases of the token will be collected by CryptoSolarTech following a process specified by CoinFabrik.

The tokens are issued immediately from each contribution, but may only be transferred after the completion of the sale process on July 25th, 2018.

CryptoSolarTech token (CST) is a ERC-20 token which works in the Ethereum Blockchain. Its quality is determined by two factors:

1. Its code is public on GitHub, with the aim that it can be verified and studied by users.

2. It has been written and audited by Coinfabrik, a company specialized in cryptocurrencies, Fintech and Blockchain systems development.

The CST Smart Contract is a contract that among its technical characteristics stands out for its transparency (both the number of tokens held by any user as well as the information of the transfers is public and traceable in time) and property (only the users of the Ethereum Wallets can be token holders, which are unipersonal and cannot be transferred by another user who that is not the owner of these), intrinsic features that tokens at the platform in which it is created, provide.

On the other hand, only the owner of the contract can perform the issuance of CST tokens, give up ownership in favour of any other user or Ethereum contract or even stop / resume transfer of tokens between holders. Any call to the contract that generates an error does not change the tokens of the users or the balance of Ether except for the gas or Gwei spent on the transaction. The maximum number of CST tokens in circulation set in the contract can be configured, but it is limited to 1,260,000,000.

This token enables the holders to rent mining equipment. To do so, the user must deposit them in a Smart Contract and choose among the mining models that will exist in the platform.

## 6.2 CRYPTOSOLARTECH PLATFORM

The CryptoSolarTech mining platform will be the one that allows to use the tokens purchased during the ICO. This platform will be able to access choosing between two mining plans: “individual plan” and “trading plan by the CryptoSolarTech team”.
The operation of the platform is described here below:

In the CryptoSolarTech platform, the interfaces will monitor the mining activities individually, choosing between the algorithms selected from the different cryptocurrencies (SHA256 for Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash, SCRYPT for Litecoin or Verge, GPU for Ethereum or Ethereum Classic, XII for Dash among others) or choosing between the different CryptoSolarTech custom mining plans offered at the investor’s choice for its rental.

**ALGORITHM SELECT**

Deutsche eMark|DEM| |Verge|XVE| |Influxcoin|INFX| |Feathercoin|FTC
Digibyte|DGB| |Gulden|NLG| |Monetaryunit|MUE| |Ethereum Classic|ETC

* INDIVIDUAL MINING

The user can choose this type of mining, where you can mine up to 20 coins as a base, and over time coins will be added or removed according to the demand of the users. In this type of mining, the generated yields will go to the wallet that the user chooses and 20% will be deducted when a block is found. This commission will be directed to maintenance expenses, R & D, equipment renewal and increase of photovoltaic panels.


* MINING TRADING

Here the user can choose a plan to obtain a fixed profitability, which the CryptoSolarTech team obtains through its algorithm. The platform will have the following options when the plan expires:

• Take profit and choose another plan according to the number of CST tokens hold
• Take profit and choose individual mining according to the stored CST tokens
• Take profit and choose another plan with a lower amount than the total of CST’s and use the remaining amount to choose individual mining
• Freeze CST tokens activity

**PLAN “A”**| |**PLAN “B”**| |**PLAN “C”**
:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:
3 MONTHS| |6 MONTHS| |12 MONTHS
6,00%| |15,00%| |36,00%
% PRICE PER TOKEN (0,10€)| |% PRICE PER TOKEN (0,10€)| |% PRICE PER TOKEN (0,10€)

* WITHDRAWAL SYSTEMS

In the personal area of each user there will be a section to withdraw their cryptocurrencies, there are two options depending on how the mining has taken place:

1.  INDIVIDUAL MINING PLATFORM

Here you can withdraw the returns in the currency that the user has chosen, for example, if you chose to mine in 2 different currencies, you can withdraw based on these currencies.

2. TRADING MINING PLATFORM

Here you can withdraw the returns only in Ethereum, since a Smart Contract will be responsible for sending the returns to the user based on the plan that has been chosen.

* ONLINE SECURITY PLATFORM

The computer security infrastructure of CryptoSolarTech will consist of the following features:

A double crown system, with two different manufacturers in each part of the crown, such as the PaloAlto + Cisco tandem, this allows us to assemble a DMZ to give output to the miners and entry to maintenance personnel.

Another advantage of mounting a double crown with two different manufacturers is that if a vulnerability appears in one of them, it does not extend to the other, isolating it.

Both systems will be mounted in HA, thus ensuring connectivity with the mining servers and the balancing of the network load.

Managed network switches are used to build ACLs according to the needs of investors and limit access to miners according to the user or its use.

In the DMZ a hardening server will be implemented in bridge mode to be able to be accessed from outside, the connection to this server will be made by VPN and the access to the corresponding VLAN will be assigned, meaning only those that have permits can access the miners.

Each miner, being Linux systems, will be independently hardened to obtain the best possible security, if at any moment a harsh force or any other type of attack is detected, the miner will automatically warn the firewalls and close the connection both on the perimeter as well as internally.

Due to the complexity of the facilities and the amount of information that will be generated and its importance, there will be a Security Operations Center (SOC) which will handle the information collected by the different areas of the network and systems, monitoring it for check that there is no security breach, if a breach occurs, CryptoSolarTech has a specialized team to resolve and mitigate these possible incidents as soon as possible.

* OFFLINE SECURITY PLATFORM

At CryptoSolarTech we strongly take care when it comes to the safety of the facilities and, therefore, we are working with a leading company in the sector in Spain to design a complete and efficient infrastructure. Here we detail the most important points that will ensure CryptoSolarTech are equipped with facilities keeping a certain level of security and total control:

The objective is to protect CryptoSolarTech with a Grade 3 alarm, as used by jewellery establishments and industries, museums, fuel supplies, security companies, among others.

This system complies with the provisions of RD 2364/1994 in Articles 111 and so forth and in Order INT 317/2011, which establishes the physical and electronic protection measures of each establishment.

What elements are mandatory?

1. The Alarm System in this case, will be wired, which means that to be able to handle detectors and other components, the facilities must be accessed first, the security cannot be violated via Wireless.

2. It will be possible to control up to 48 different zones of access points, dead spots, and areas where greater security is needed, as well as being able to register the activity of up to 100 users and an autonomy of 30 hours in the event of an electric power cut.

3. It has a double communication path, which allows it to continue functioning in response to attacks due to inhibition or sabotage.

4. Triple UPS protection, allows the system to continue running, offering an energy backup in case of power failure.

5. Connection to the Alarm Receiving Centre, 24/7, which allows quick warning in the event of an intrusion or unforeseen circumstances at the facilities, in addition to being connected to the closed circuit television, a video surveillance in real time, wired for greater security that allows the recording of images and control from any part in the world, even from our Smartphone.


This whole system is divided into motion detectors, sensors at access points to the facilities, 24/7 surveillance cameras connected to the central security centre and finally, there are locks with access control.

Each component, and thanks to the mobile application offered by the security company, we can verify its operating correctly and have more detailed control in case of emer-gency.

You can watch live through the cameras and see what happens at the facilities, in addition to allowing a constant or timely recording on the memory of our Smartphone or mobile device.

The access control will be established with an electronic lock system, also supplied by the same company, which works as follows:

Each user has an electronic key with their personal ID, this key allows us to configure the time allowed to enter or leave the premises or certain areas of the premises. If a restricted user in an area tries to access, it will be communicated through a notification on the mobile phone or via SMS to the responsible person, knowing that someone is trying to access a restricted area or outside their allowed timetable.

This lock system will also allow us to control the entry and exit, obeying the timetable of each member of the team.

In case of loss of the electronic key, it can automatically be blocked, and if it is forgotten at home, it can be opened using the same application that controls the security system.

As a novelty in this electronic lock, we want to add that it is an “anti-bumping” lock, so if you try to break or manipulate the system from any point, the lock is locked becoming inaccessible. Similarly, if a door is left open for a certain time that has previously been configured, the system will send a warning.

Finally, the fire protection system will be equipped with different components to prevent any incident that could possibly arise.

Temperature, smoke and flame detectors will be installed, helping the system to activate at the indicated time and prevent further damage.

Given the criteria of the facilities, where all the components work with electricity, the protection system that will be used is a system with chemical agents, which will allow to extinguish and / or control a possible fire in a clean manner and without damaging the environment. Liquefied and inert gases will be used.

Like the intrusion alarm, the fire prevention system will be connected 24/7 to the central centre, so it will help us to be more effective in the event of an incident by notifying us at the same time.

### 6.3 SMART CONTRACTS OF THE CRYPTOSOLARTECH PLATFORM

CoinFabrik will develop these Smart Contracts where the CST tokens will be deposited to rent the mining equipment or to subscribe to any of the plans. The interaction with this Smart Contract will be done through the platform, but the private keys will be managed by the users.

CryptoSolarTech will hire industry-leading independent auditors who review each line of the smart contract code, verifying security, incentive or other concerns regarding the surface of ​an attack. This is the way to ensure the security of this sensitive code.

### 6.4 AML MANAGEMENT

The ICO CryptoSolarTech and its next plataform will have an AML / KYC system in place to satisfy all legal requirements, so it will be mandatory for users to verify their identity through our own AML/KYC system.

The AML measures will be implemented with Lleidasoftware1.

In certain countries, transactions such as ICO participation or other cryptocurrency transactions are considered MSB (Money Service Business). In addition, strictly speaking, a person becomes a money transmitter when they accept the rules of an ICO or an Exchange, by transmitting money, from one person to another, securities or any other asset that generates value. 

As financial institutions, MSBs must comply with regulations and laws regarding bank secrecy, including AML (Anti-Money Laundering) and KYC (Know-Your-Customer).

All processes related to AML / KYC will be developed prior to the ICO.

1. Lleida.net is the first Certification Operator, benchmark company in the field of certified communications and telecommunications whose mission is to provide security, trust, efficiency and profitability to electronic communications of companies, public administrations and individuals, directly. It has the ISO 27001: 2013 certification, granted by BSI (The British Standards Institution), with the number IS 632576. This certification is key to compliance with global standards in information security.

## 7. ROADMAP, DEVELOPMENT AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES

## 7.1 ROADMAP

![Roadmap](https://www.dropbox.com/s/48zmkxlx1zizo5i/screenshot-cryptosolartech.org-2018.08.24-12-12-31.png)

### 7.2 FUTURE PERSPECTIVES

- PERSPECTIVE AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE TOKENIZING ECOSYSTEM.

There will be continuity in the future growth of CryptoSolarTech. The key initiative will be the progressive tokenization of its ecosystem in the Blockchain. This will be through the TGE (Tokens Generator Event), by the token issuance. Allowing CryptoSolarTech to save on costs over time and, as a consequence, achieve the desired position at the technological vanguard. Thus, revolutionizing the Solar-Mining sector (SMS) and developing the CST model whose token will be used for different purposes depending on each need and objective.

- SYSTEM TOKENIZATION

The CryptoSolarTech ecosystem model will strengthen the community as well as facilitate, accelerate and support national and international growth. This results in, providing an essential long-term union and the necessary resources in the short term. Decentralization of the ecosystem will reduce operating costs over time.

CST involves the creation of a collaborative system that can be adopted by any operator of solar and mining services. This entails those, especially who use the CST token as an instrument.

Once the TGE is completed, the company will anticipate the following phases to incorporate the CryptoSolarTech business model with tokenomics.

These mining machines will be rented according to the plans and current general conditions on the start date, as well as in proportion to the tokens owned in relation to the number of tokens issued in the TGE. The holders will pay a rent for entering the mining program and, as possessors of tokens, they will receive a bonus depending on the number of tokens they have.

The mining facility will begin to mine a portfolio of cryptocurrencies. CST token holders will chose between all cryptocurrency options in the mining pool starting off with their personalized portfolio or, on the other hand, select the team’s edit portfolio based on market spot price cryptocurrency algorithms in the market. There are, mined from a pre-designed portfolio management that will be continuously operative until the expiration period of itself.

The rent of the mining plant will consist of 20.00% of the total revenues in crypto assets and will be paid in the same crypto asset that the owner will receive according to the power that has been acquired. The remaining amount of crypto assets will be granted to the owner but without the proportional costs of mining them. With the option the CryptoSolarTech program offers, this net amount of cryptocurrencies will be settled according to the mining plan chosen on the platform, and it will be automatically sent to the addresses of Ethereum Wallets indicated by the owner.

A secondary market will be organized by an Exchange to be able to trade the tokens and these can be aquired by new owners.

The Token value will be linked to the value of the CST network (network value tokens) depending on the success of the mining plant for each reward block by block. For this, there will be a contract settlement that will depend, again, on the plan chosen in the platform.

### 7.3 ACTION PLAN

- Private Sale: From 16th of April 2018 until the end of April 2018.

- Public Sale: From the end of the private sale until July 2018.

.|**Period of Sales**|**nº Tokens**|**%**
:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:

Token Sale| |1,260,000,000.00|100.00%

The dates can change depending on the development of the ICO. The information will be updated on the ICO website www.CryptoSolarTech.org. However, the public sale will be launched during the second quarter of 2018.

### 7.4 REVENUE MANAGEMENT

To explain revenue management we must differentiate between two cases:

* If the customer is the one who performs the cryptocurrency mining (individual mining), the rental cost will be 20% of the cryptocurrencies obtained by mining, which may change due to a modification in the future depending on the mining adjustment and the mining difficulty. As well as due to other circumstances that can not be mitigated to this day.

* If, on the contrary, the client chooses the CryptoSolarTech team to perform the mining, then the 20% rental cost will be integrated into the cost of the Plan that he/she has chosen. The return plan that the client has selected will be sent to the Smart Contract that will be transferred to the client´s Wallet, where the client bought the CST.

That is, for example, if the client bought 10,000 CST and we take the value of € 0.1 per token- and selected the one-year plan, this will provide a benefit of 36% per year. Like this, at the end of the year, we will have: 10,000 CST * € 0.1 + 36% = € 1,360 of profit that the Smart Contract will automatically send on eth basis to the client´s Wallet (for an investment of € 1,000). 

The fees obtained from the rental of the mining farm will be used for its operations and maintenance to have the greenfield facilities in efficient and profitable conditions.
