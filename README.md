### 1 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
---
Before cryptocurrency mining turned out to be an expensive business model in terms of initial investment and maintenance, this was a sector that was fractioned and generally distributed between a few thousand individuals, whose activity resulted in having a low environmental impact and its profitability rised exponentially inside a transparency model with democratized rules which facilitated the power of decision inside the network.

Today, because of the huge rise in the use of cryptocurrencies and Blockchain (which has led to a rise of the traffic within transactions, reducing profitability at the same time) making a small **mining business** so non-viable for its primary outlays (infrastructure, servers) and expenses (electricity, maintenance, fixing servers, etc.), it is vital to arran-ge a competitive system that allows to maintain the updated hash power and the increase in the mining dificulty over time, as well as the ability to adapt for the upcoming technological developments in the crypto-mining market.

It is here where CryptoSolarTech comes onto the scene.

CryptoSolarTech is a Spanish Blockchain project of positive impact coming up from one of the most potential niches of the Blockchain market worldwide, integrating renewa-ble energy and cryptocurrency mining in the same project, employing photovoltaic solar panels to create enough electricity to supply the overwhelming energy consumption of the mining activity.  


CST is backed by some some of the best Blockchain, cryptocurrency mining experts such as CoinFabrik and PuzzleGold, assisted as well by Respira Energia (renewables), and IG (business development).  

CryptoSolarTech will mine cryptocurrencies from a farm of up to 3,000 mining servers managed by the company itself. The energy will be indirectly supplied from several photovoltaic solar panels at a solar field installed in Spain and will also provide rental services to CST token holders. Ethereum Blockchain platform will be used for the mana-gement, income distribution and tangible asset start-up of the project.

By doing this, common problems in the mining sector will be solved, such as the high expenses in crypto-mining electricity (bringing them down to levels close to 0 €), the inaccessibility resulted by the centralization and monopolization of mining power in the hands of large corporations, usage of non-renewable energy in crypto-mining (mainly fossil and nuclear resources) and marginalization of customers/investors who are not qualified or have little knowledge in mining and are looking forward into this business model of infinite opportunities.

It will be one of the safest options and opportunities to participate in the cryptocurrency market with no chance of losing: cryptocurrency mining will always bring an advantage to the user.

The purpose of this ICO is to obtain enough funding to create a cryptocurrency mining farm and install the photovoltaic solar plant meant to supply the mining equipment with cheap and clean energy after aquiring the servers.

During the ICO a total amount of 1.26 billion tokens will be issued under the name of CryptoSolarTech Token, the ticker will be CST. All unsold tokens at the end of the ICO will be burned.

#### 1.1 WHY SHOULD YOU INVEST IN CRYPTOSOLARTECH?

CryptoSolarTech is a project that comes from the hands of two Spanish cryptocurrency and Blockchain pioneers, Pablo Alonso and Alain Aguirre. It is a new wave meant to transform the world of cryptocurrency mining and at the same time strengthen the Blockchain network.

It will use sustainable energy to carry out the cryptomining process, which will help to reduce the environmental impact and be able to consume energy at a user level that comes from clean and renewable sources. It will reduce both the consumption of electricity and therefore the energy expenditure, and customers will obtain a profitability through the tokens and its platform, well above what any current photovoltaic / solar energy project can offer. This will also take the mining of cryptocurrency to a new and more favorable level for the environment and, at at the same time, maximazing effciency.

In addition, CryptoSolarTech provides investors the opportunity to participate in a high-risk market such as the cryptocurrency market, obtaining a very high return, but holding all the investment in a low risk market with high profitability such as the solar energy market.

What distinguish us from other mining services -pools- is that the signed contract to make your rented ASIC –mining server- operative, is a long-term contract due to the CST token is non-expirable as long as you hold them. That is, even if mining or electricity costs go up, your ASIC will never stop working since the energy cost is already covered (15-year extendable supply contract with Respira Energía).

When acquiring the CST token, the investor gains access to the mining platform by deciding if he himself will be the actual individual miner or if he decides to select one rate with a fixed profitability, being the CryptoSolarTech team the one providing the mining activity, following predetermined profitability plans.

According with this, CryptoSolarTech is the SAFEST way for the investor to participate in the high-risk crypto market since the solar energy plant supports all the invest-ment.

Also, CryptoSolarTech has a long-term sustainable project since there is a possibility of tokenizing the solar energy in the future with a minimum profitability of the 8%.

Last but not least, CryptoSolarTech is a project that is committed to clean energy, so by investing in it, we take a step forward in the battle against climate change, making possible the mining of cryptocurrencies, respecting the environment at the same time.
