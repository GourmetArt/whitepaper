# Guidelines for contribution

## How to contribute

### Using Github _Issues_

Use issues to:
- make general comments
- raise your concerns
- ask a question
- request more details, explanation

We will do our best to answer as fast as possible all issues created by the community.

If you are not familiar with Github, look up the [Github user guide to create an issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/)

### Using _Pull requests_

Use pull requests to suggest modifications to the paper. Here are a few guidelines for pull request creation:
- Please make your edits following the wiki markup language [Markdown Formatting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), they will be easier to merge that way.
- 1 pull request per change please.
- Give your pull request a subject/title that describes the edit.

We will do our best to address pull requests created by the community as quickly as possible. If the modification is a "no brainer" for reviewers we will merge it instantly, if not we will engage in a conversation with its creators to understand how best we can make use of his/her suggestions or explain why we are rejecting it.

If you are not familiar with Github look up the [Github user guide to create pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).

## Code of Conduct

### Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at [INSERT EMAIL ADDRESS]. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
